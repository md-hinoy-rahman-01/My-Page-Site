      <h2>üè´ Reflections</h2>

      <h3>Dublin City University</h3>
      <p>
        My time at DCU has been transformative. Pursuing an MSc in Computing with a focus on Data Analytics has pushed me to explore the depths of machine learning, data engineering, and AI ethics. I‚Äôve worked on benchmarking large language models and diving into real-world data challenges ‚Äî and it‚Äôs been thrilling. DCU has given me the tools and confidence to think critically and build responsibly in the tech space.
      </p>

      <h3>Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST)</h3>
      <p>
        MIST was where my technical foundation was built. Studying Computer Science and Engineering taught me discipline, precision, and creativity. I led projects like a blockchain-based voting system and an ERP for e-waste management ‚Äî both of which challenged me to think beyond code and into impact. MIST shaped my engineering mindset and gave me the courage to experiment.
      </p>

      <h3>Notre Dame College</h3>
      <p>
        Notre Dame was more than academics ‚Äî it was where I found my voice. I graduated with a perfect GPA, but what I cherish most is my time with the debating club. Being on the senior panel taught me how to listen, argue, and lead. It was here that I learned the power of words and the importance of perspective ‚Äî lessons I carry into every room I enter.
